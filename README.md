# ZailabBank

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

## Init

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Technologies used

- Typescript
- Bootstrap
- template: sb-admin-2 https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/
- I choose Angular 2 because of the Web component Architecture, i thought it would be relevant since your app is built with Aurelia
